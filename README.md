# X-Ray Convolutional Neural Network
A Keras simplified implementation based on [ChesXNet](https://github.com/zoogzog/chexnet) for pathology detection in frontal chest X-ray images which was in turn based on the original paper presented [here](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnet/). 
Learning was the main motivation for this work.



# Dataset
The ChestX-ray dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray with 14 disease labels, which are later simplified into 0(Normal xray) and 1(Abnormal xray - Pathology found).



# Preprocessing
Preprocessing was applied before training, and images saved to new databse (./database_preprocessed/...).
<br><br>
The preprocessing consists in:
  * Applying Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to correct contrast.
  * Resize images from 1024x1024p to 128x128p (Bigger dimensions would be preferable as most often patologies appear on a small area on the image, which might get lost or distorted upon resize. The dimensions were limited by the GPU memory).

# Usage
  * Clone repository.
  * Download the ChestX-ray14 database from [here](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/folder/37178474737).
  * Unpack archives in separate directories (e.g. images_001.tar.gz into images_001).
  * Run PreprocessData.py to create new database with processed data.
  * Run Main.py with desired Parameters.
  
# Results
The custom neural Network was able to achive an accuracy of 70% on the test data after 3h(15min/batch) of incomplete training on a GTX950M, using a small portion of the dataset(15k images). The NN model selection and training time/samples was limited by the hardware and itÂ´s availability for training.
##### Better results could be achieved by using:
  * Better hardware(GPU memory didnt allow for bigger models/batches/image sizes)
  * More data and longer training times.
  * Better NN models.
  * Diferent Preprocessing.
